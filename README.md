# Bharadwaj Classes
This repository presents a hybrid educational management system featuring both a **Tkinter-based Python GUI** and a **fully responsive Bootstrap-powered front-end website**. Built for the fictional "Bharadwaj Classes", it offers a complete student experience - from registration to course enrollment and payments, via both desktop software and modern web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Developed a robust **Tkinter GUI** application for login, registration, course selection, and payment with a QR-based confirmation system.
- Created a parallel **Bootstrap website** with fully responsive layout, smooth navigation, newsletter, instructor cards, FAQ accordion, Google Form integration, and Leaflet-based live map display.
- Incorporated realistic content structure mimicking real-world educational platforms, offering three learning modes—Virtual, Hybrid, and In-Person—with pricing and benefits.

---

## ✅ Important Takeaways

- Practiced full-stack design by converting a Python GUI into an aesthetic, interactive website using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JS**.
- Learned responsive UI principles, modal forms, embedded Google Forms, font icons (Bootstrap Icons), accordion behaviors, and map APIs.
- Gained experience in aligning front-end design with back-end logic by visually replicating the original Python GUI workflow on the web.
