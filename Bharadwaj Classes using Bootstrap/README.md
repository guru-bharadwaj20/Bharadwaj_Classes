# Bharadwaj Classes

A sleek and modern educational website built using **HTML5**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **minimal CSS**. Designed as a single-page site, it provides a clean interface for showcasing learning formats, instructors, FAQs, enrollment, and even location maps—all with responsive behavior and Bootstrap styling.

## Features

The site starts with a sticky navbar and a hero section featuring a call-to-action button linked to an embedded Google Form modal. Sections include course options (Virtual, Hybrid, In-Person), program highlights, FAQs using accordion, and instructor profiles with cards and social links. The contact section displays detailed info alongside a dynamic Leaflet.js map. The layout is entirely responsive, thanks to Bootstrap 5 grid system and utility classes, requiring very little custom CSS.
